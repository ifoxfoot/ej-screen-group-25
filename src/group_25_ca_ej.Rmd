```{r}
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>%

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = ces, aes(x=white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score)) + geom_hex() + labs(x = "Percent White", y = "CalEnviroScreen (CES) Score", title = "CES Score and racial makeup of CA Cenus Tracts")+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange")+
  theme_minimal()
```

The graph above shows a trend of populations with a higher percent of white people tending to have a lower CalEnviroScreen(CES) Score. The orange tiles, show a high frequency of the corresponding percentage of white people. The highest frequencies occur around 0 percent white, where there is a higher CES score, and arounf 75 percet white where there is a lower CES score.
